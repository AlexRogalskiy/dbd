# dbd examples
This directory contains example dbd models for multiple databases. If you are still discovering dbd basics, start with
the [sqlite examples](https://github.com/zsvoboda/dbd/tree/master/examples/sqlite) as the SQLite database doesn't 
require any extra installation and configuration. 

With all other example sets, you'll need to have access to a specific database server 
to run them.
